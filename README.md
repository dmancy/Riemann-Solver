# Riemann-Solver
Hello
The entry parameters must be the left values W L = (ρ L , u L , p L ), the right values W R = (ρ R , u R , p R ), the specific heat ratio γ (assume it to be the same on both sides of the initial discontinuity), and the sampling point x/t where the solution is to be determined.
