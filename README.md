# Riemann-Solver

This program solves a Riemann problem by providing the left state W L = (ρ L , u L , p L ), right state W R = (ρ R , u R , p R ) and gamma, the heat capacity ratio.
The class Riemann provides methods to plot the density, velocity and pressure plots at a givet time t, as well as x-t diagrams.

The source code is in the repository src/

### Prerequisites
The file main.py gathers all the 3 cases of Task 2 as presented in the Mini-Project.

To run the code, any version of python must be installed.
The command line is:
